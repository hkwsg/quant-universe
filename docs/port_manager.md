## Components

### TaxLot Class

- **Purpose**: Manages individual tax lots.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  tax_lot = TaxLot(security_id, purchase_date, cost_basis, quantity)
  ```

### SecurityPosition Class

- **Purpose**: Manages the collection of tax lots for a particular security.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  security_position = SecurityPosition(security_id)
  security_position.add_tax_lot(tax_lot)
  ```

### Transaction Class

- **Purpose**: Represents a single transaction.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  transaction = Transaction(security_id, transaction_date, quantity, price, transaction_type)
  ```

### TransactionHistory Class

- **Purpose**: Manages transaction history.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  transaction_history = TransactionHistory()
  transaction_history.add_transaction(transaction)
  ```

### ReturnCalculator Class

- **Purpose**: Calculates returns for various assets.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  return_calculator = ReturnCalculator(transaction_history)
  ```

### Portfolio Class

- **Purpose**: Manages the overall portfolio.
- **Usage**:
  ```python
  portfolio = Portfolio()
  portfolio.add_transaction(transaction)
  ```

## Examples

### Creating a Portfolio

```python
portfolio = Portfolio()
portfolio.add_transaction(Transaction("AAPL", datetime(2022, 1, 10), 10, 150.0, "buy"))
portfolio.add_transaction(Transaction("AAPL", datetime(2023, 1, 10), 5, 170.0, "sell"))
```

### Calculating Portfolio Return

```python
current_prices = {"AAPL": 170.0}
return = portfolio.calculate_portfolio_return(current_prices, datetime(2022, 1, 1))
```

### Generating Portfolio Summary

```python
summary = portfolio.get_portfolio_summary(current_prices)
```

## Best Practices

- Regularly update market prices for accurate portfolio valuation.
- Validate all input data for transactions.
- Handle exceptions and edge cases (e.g., missing data).

## FAQs/Troubleshooting
